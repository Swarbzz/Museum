### Introduction
This exercise is purely for me to understand single-source-of-truth and also the has-many-through relationship.

### Exercise
I will be looking at the relationship that an artist has bewteen their artwork and also the relationship that a museum has with that artwork and how it all interlinks. 

### TDD
I may write some tests along the way for some more practice but that is not my priority.
